# pixelpusher
PixelPusher is a multi screen mosaic system that allows the user to link multiple devices through www.pixelpush.us together and 
display an image or animation as one cohesive display. This project was inspired by and built for CS4784 Human-Computer
Interaction Capstone at Virginia Tech.

Team Behind the Project

The project uses Phalcon PHP and WebSockets to try to make the most efficient data transfer possible to achieve a smooth 
effect across all devices.

***Note:*** Due to the cost of keeping a server running, this project is currently not hosted on any server. The dedicated
url is www.pixelpush.us, but it is not active at the moment.
